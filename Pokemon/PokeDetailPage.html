      			Bulbasaur, known as Fushigidane in Japan, is the first Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. Designed by Ken Sugimori, their name is a combination of the words "bulb" and "dinosaur." Bulbasaur are small, squat reptilian and plant Pokémon that move on all four legs, and have light blue-green bodies with darker blue-green spots.

The seed on a Bulbasaur's back is planted at birth and then sprouts and grows larger as the Bulbasaur grows
